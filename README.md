# Python Projects

This repository contains several Python projects, each designed to demonstrate basic programming concepts and logic. Below are the details of the included projects.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Bagels Game
*Description*: A deductive logic game where players guess a secret number based on clues.
- **Features**:
  - Player inputs the number of digits and maximum guesses.
  - Clues include:
    - **Pico**: One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
    - **Fermi**: One digit is correct and in the correct position.
    - **Bagels**: No digits are correct.
- **Usage**: Run the script, and follow the prompts to play.

### 2. Caesar Cipher
*Description*: A simple encryption method that shifts letters by a specified key.
- **Features**:
  - Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message.
  - Supports only uppercase letters (A-Z).
  - The result can be copied to the clipboard if `pyperclip` is installed.
- **Usage**: Run the script, select whether to encrypt or decrypt, input the key and message.

### 3. Caesar Cipher Hacker
*Description*: A tool to hack messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher using brute-force.
- **Features**:
  - Attempts to decrypt a message using all possible keys (0-25).
- **Usage**: Run the script, and input the encrypted message to see all possible decryptions.

### 4. Statistical Analysis Tool
*Description*: A comprehensive tool for calculating various statistical metrics from user-inputted data.
- **Features**:
  - Calculates mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and more.
  - Visualizes data through pie charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots.
- **Usage**: Run the script and input a series of numbers separated by spaces for analysis.
